## Problem Statement

Personally speaking, I have found myself in a situation trying to get a car over the
phone but all lines seemed busy, or maybe I was in a noisy place, where it’s difficult
to speak, or vice versa, somewhere I had to be quiet. A tricky task at times. Modern life is busy and dynamic. 
No wonder people lay their hands on anything that can make things quicker and easier. Car rental software development 
significantly simplifies the entire process of booking a car.  \newline   

My client has some personal vehicles at disposal for people looking to rent a car
for a given period. But for the time being my client runs fully his business on his
phone(s) by receiving calls of people who want to rent some of his vehicle, or those
that need a car for a certain period, but does not have the desire or opportunity to
buy it. \newline   

He wants to go digital and to accept online reservations and manage his fleet with
ease. In today’s digital environment, users would rather book cars online instead
of calling the rental company to make reservations. If you are running a car rental
business, developing a car rental software becomes a must. \newline   

I got in touch with him to implement a well-designed car rental system to help
not only him accept online reservations and manage his entire fleet but as well as his
potential customers reserve available cars online. This car rental system should allow
him to run his business smoothly and effectively. \newline

## Stakeholder(s)

Several	types of stakeholders can be noted when it comes to any	software. 
The	most obvious are those that requested for this software. In my case it's my Dutch born client that basically hired me to 
develop this car rental management web based application for his upcoming business.  

## Aim and Objectives    

Below is the objectives of this project : 

- Develop a user-friendly & secure system that protects client information as well as confidential information of the company
  
- A customer self-service platform to view vehicle availability in real-time,
  
- 24/7 accepting online reservations,
  
- Removing the paper-based processes,
  
- Detailed analytics and statistics, i.e., the software should deliver an up-to-date analytics to see how his business performs,
  
- Avoiding risks of overbooking and the factor of human error,
  
- The reservations' timeline to track the status of the vehicle due for maintenance, for delivery or pick-up, or currently on the road, 
  
- Cuts down on administration processes to improve business efficiency,
  
- Making data-driven decisions based on detailed statistics,
  
- Feedback system for clients to give reviews and rate the service,
  
- Provide an estimation of the influx of bookings to prepare for future demands.

## Scope of Proposal

The scope of a system is there to define its boundaries. In other words, what is in scope and what is out of scope. 

The scope can be presented from user aspect of view : 

- The platform should 24/7 available to customers

- The system does not support online payment at the moment 

- This system is for use by only one company (my client).

- Rented cars should be used at the moment in one country Belgium

- No mobile application will be developed for this car rental web application.
