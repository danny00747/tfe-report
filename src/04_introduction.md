::: note

The car rental management system presented in this report is a web-based application for the stakeholder's company 
that's accessible to the public through the web and furthermore it was developed to keep and maintain records
about reservations. \newline

The main feature of this application is to keep tracks of vehicles, customers and booking.
The latter provides useful information to the administrator such as making reports of booked vehicles and acts
as a vehicle management system by monitoring the use and price of these vehicles. From the customers point of view, 
this application helps them find that car to move from one place to another for business 
or school purposes, tour, and sightseeing occasions. Thus, making it extremely useful.

## Problem Statement

Personally speaking, I have found myself in a situation trying to get a car over the
phone but all lines seemed busy, or maybe I was in a noisy place, where it’s difficult
to speak, or vice versa, somewhere I had to be quiet. A tricky task at times. Modern life is busy and dynamic. 
No wonder people lay their hands on anything that can make things quicker and easier. Car rental software development 
significantly simplifies the entire process of booking a car.  

The stakeholder has some personal vehicles at disposal for people looking to rent a car
for a given period. He wants to go digital and to accept online reservations and manage his fleet with
ease. In today’s digital environment, customers would rather book cars online instead
of calling the rental company to make reservations. If you are running a car rental
business, developing a car rental software becomes a must.

I got in touch with him through a mutual acquaintance to implement a well-designed car rental system to help
not only manage and maintain his entire fleet online but as well as his potential customers book available cars 
on the to-be developed website. This car rental application should allow him to run his business smoothly and effectively. 

## Stakeholder(s)

Several	types of stakeholders can be identified when it comes to any software. 
The	most obvious are those that requested a system to be developed. In my case it's my Dutch born client that basically 
hired me (_figuratively speaking_) to develop this car rental management web based application for his upcoming business.  

## Aim and Objectives    

Below are the objectives of this project : 

- Develop a user-friendly & secure system that protects client information as well as confidential information of the company
  
- A customer self-service platform to view vehicle availability in real-time,
  
- 24/7 online system to allow customers to book cars,
  
- Remove the paper-based processes,
  
- Detailed analytics and statistics, i.e., the software should deliver an up-to-date analytics on customers' reservations,
  
- Avoiding risks of overbooking and reduce the factor of human error,
  
- The reservations' management system to track vehicles due for maintenance, booked ones, or currently on the road, 
  
- Provide customers the ability to apply different filters while searching for available cars,

- Provide customers the ability to cancel their reservation,
  
- Make data-driven decisions based on detailed statistics,
  
- Feedback system for clients to give reviews and rate the service,
  
- Provide an estimation of the influx of bookings to prepare for future demands.

## Scope of Proposal

The scope of an application is there to define its boundaries. In other words, what is in scope and what is out of scope.

- The platform should 24/7 available to customers

- The system does not support online payment at the moment 

- This system is for use by only one company

- Rented cars should be used at the moment in one country Belgium

- No mobile application will be developed for this car rental web application at the moment.
