First and the foremost, I am grateful to my supervisor, Louis VAN DORMAEL, for insightful conversations during
the development of this project, and for helpful comments on what should be corrected. \newline

Finally, I would like to thank the various EPHEC professors who helped me to obtain the skills required 
to accomplish this task. \newline
