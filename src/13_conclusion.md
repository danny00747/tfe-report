The development of this application taught me a lot. I had the opportunity to improve myself in the Java 
programming language ecosystem by using multiple libraries to develop some features. Overall im completely 
gratified with the final product. The application is fully operational and bug-free, customers can book their cars
anytime - any day - anywhere ! \newline \newline
