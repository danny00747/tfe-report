Chapter 3 : Requirements Analysis and Design
=============================================

## Overview

This chapter contains the analysis and design of car rental web based application system, the type of
the methodology, function and non-functional requirements of this application and 
software tools that were used during the development phase. In addition, this chapter contains UML diagrams, 
the database design, application architecture to better understand how the application is designed.

## Proposed Methodology

Methodology in software development is the process of dividing the latter into distinct phases to improve design, 
product quality etc... Each of methodology is chosen based on the nature of the application to be implemented and on what 
the stakeholders of the system required. For this particular application **Prototyping model** was chosen.

### Prototyping Model

**Prototyping model** was chosen firstly because it allowed me to implement many prototypes which were presented to the application stakeholder in order to get
some feed-back based on how the final application should look and work from his point of view. Secondly because I knew that
stakeholder was going to be heavily involved during the application development which helped him not only get as soon as possible
a glimpse of us how the application works and looks but as well as catch errors as they came.

### Approach to Prototyping Methodology

Prototyping methodology has many software development life cycle (**SDLC**) phases, at the first stage,
what I did was gather all non-functional and functional application requirements are gathered from the stakeholder 
by talking him, then moved to the second stage by designing of the application which was presented as a preview of the
application system to the stakeholder in order to identify flaws of the latter. The third stage was about refining the 
prototype according to feedback I was able to gather from the stakeholder.
