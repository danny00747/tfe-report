This Car Rental System project is designed to aid my client manage his cars up for rent through an 
online system. The latter has many features such as users can search for available cars; view profile; book the car 
for the time period; administrator can keep track of all the customers' information. \newline

This system increases customer retention and maximizes efficiency when it came to automating all car reservation tasks 
and receiving up-to-date important business statistics. \newline

By using this system, the admin can manage their rental, bookings, profiles, car details etc. It has a user-friendly interface 
which helps the user to check for cars and rent them for the period specified. Upon a successful reservation the customer 
receives a confirmation email detailing everything he/she needs to know about their reservation. \newline

The main focus of this project is to help any user  easily find a car that
available in the system as well as help my client manage rented cars and users in the system efficiently. \newline

To propose the best possible car available to the client a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution
