This Car Rental System project is designed to aid the stakeholder manage his cars that are up for rent through an 
online reservation system. The latter has many features such as users can search for available cars; view profile; book the car 
for a given time period and so much more... \newline

By using this application, the administrator can manage all registered customers, reservations and available car details. 
It has a user-friendly interface which helps a customer search for rented cars and book any of them for a specified period. 
Upon a successful reservation a customer receives a confirmation email detailing everything the latter needs to know 
about their reservation. \newline

The main focus of this project is to help any customers easily find a car that's
available in the system as well as help the stakeholder manage rented cars and customers in the system efficiently. \newline

To propose the best possible available car to customers a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution
(TOPSIS), was used. More on this later. \newline
